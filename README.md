This project is a Python-based AI chatbot built with a Streamlit UI and powered by free, open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) accessed via the OpenRouter API.
It supports multimodal models (text-based and model-dependent capabilities) while remaining completely free to use within OpenRouter’s supported limits.
